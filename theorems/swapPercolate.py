'''
swapPercolate moves swaps through parenteses.
swaps are permitted to move left through "(", "<", and "["
e.g.

(<>()) --> <>(())

Because swaps return zero,
swaps are permitted to move left through "]" and ">" aswell.
e.g.

[()]<> --> [()<>]

swapPercolate helps to clump swaps together so that they can be dealt with by swapElim

(The two might be combinable into one simpler function)
