reducablePushes finds all regex matches in with a zeroReturn at the start

This will return a list of zeros that are reducable

zeroReduce makes pushing zeros to the stack more effective

It does this by capturing and zeroing zero returning code segments

e.g.
 {}(<><>)  -->   (<{}>)

({}(<><>)) --> ({}(<><>))
